>LangTurbo is a podcast player designed to help you discover podcasts in your target language and achieve fluency faster.

## Why podcasts?

Motivation is key to success in language learning. Podcasts keep you motivated by bringing you back to your favorite shows while improving your target language along the way. You’ll learn from native speakers in real-life situations.

## How does it work?

First you find podcasts on topics you love. As you listen you’ll pick up new vocabulary with the help of translations, transcriptions, explanations of usage in context, example sentences and more. 

Over time you’ll start to remember grammar structures, improve your pronunciation and mark words as known. Real quantifiable language learning progress, no fake progress points or forced drills here.

Comprehensible input with content you love is how LangTurbo works.

## Can beginners use LangTurbo?

It works best if you have some basic knowledge of the language, but don't hesitate to start using it even if you're just starting out.

## What's the science behind this?

The key principles are: [comprehensible input](https://tprsquestionsandanswers.wordpress.com/2014/10/06/the-research-supporting-comprehensible-input/), learning with [sentences instead of words](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lang.12285), [spaced repetition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3399982/), and [shadowing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4730276) for better pronunciation.
