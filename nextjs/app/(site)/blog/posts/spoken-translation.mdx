LangTurbo uses the voices available on your device for the "Spoken Translation" feature. 

The app uses the voice with the highest quality by default, but it is possible that your device does not have the highest quality voice installed.


## On iOS

Make sure you have an English *Premium* voice. 

1. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices > English > Voice

2. Download a *Premium* voice if there is none installed

3. Restart the app

## On Android

The instructions to install a new voice is dependant on your device. 

Search the options to add better text to speech voices based on your Android version and device model.
